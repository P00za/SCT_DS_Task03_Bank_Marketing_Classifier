# SCT_DS_Task03_Bank_Marketing_Classifier
# SCT_DS_Task_03 â€“ Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset
This repository contains the solution for *Task 3 (SCT_DS_Task_03)* assigned during my Data Science Internship at *Skillcraft Technology*.

## Task Objective

To build and evaluate a *Decision Tree Classifier* to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a *term deposit, using the **Bank Marketing Dataset* from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

##  Key Steps

- ðŸ”¹ Loaded bank.csv and bank-full.csv datasets
- ðŸ”¹ Preprocessed categorical variables using LabelEncoder
- ðŸ”¹ Trained a baseline DecisionTreeClassifier using scikit-learn
- ðŸ”¹ Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- ðŸ”¹ Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- ðŸ”¹ Visualized:
  - Feature importance
  - Decision tree structure
- ðŸ”¹ Exported model to .pkl format
- ðŸ”¹ Wrote a predict_user() function to simulate real-time predictions
